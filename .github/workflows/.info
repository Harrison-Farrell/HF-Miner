# GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

This directory contains GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow definitions.

## Files

- **ci.yml** - Comprehensive multi-platform build and test workflow
- **test.yml** - Quick unit test execution (fast feedback)
- **build.yml** - Multi-platform build verification
- **quality.yml** - Code quality and static analysis checks
- **README.md** - Workflow documentation and setup guide

## Important Notes

- Workflows are automatically triggered based on push/PR events defined in each YAML file
- All workflows use publicly available actions from GitHub Marketplace
- No sensitive data should be stored in workflow files; use GitHub Secrets for credentials
- Coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov (update token in quality.yml if needed)
